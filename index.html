<!-- 
1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/W-IJcC4tYFI).
2. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
4. Display the following on the page:
5. Press any key to get started!
6. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

7. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
8. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
9. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

User experience:

A. [Game data]
1a. Words
- Generate a list of 10 words that will make up the initial set of potential words and store in an array

B. [Game instructions state]
1b. "Press any key to get started!": Game gets activated using a key listening event
2b. "Wins:" Counter that is equal to the number of wins, updated after each win
3b. "Letters already guessed:"" Array with the letters that have been guessed
4b. "Number of guesses remaining:" Counter for the number of guesses the user has remaining

1b. Activating the game
Will be activated by a listening event so that if a user types any key, then the game will start.

When the game "starts," the following occurs (expressed with functions):
- A word is generated from 1a and stored as a var "answer"
- The "answer" is parsed into an array called "answer_arr"
- The word is not displayed to the user
- The length of the word is identified
- An array is created with the number of values equaling the length of the word, with each value equaling "_"

2b. Keeping track of wins and displaying counter
- A counter is created as a var to detect the number of times that a user wins
- A "win" is counted when the "user_word" array is equal to the "answer"
- The win condition is evaluated each time that a user makes a guess (or could be done whenever they get a "hit")

3b. Keeping track of guesses and displaying counter
- When word_complete.length = 
- 

4b. Keeping track of letters guessed and displaying array
- Create a var "user_guesses" that contains an array
- Create a var "word_complete" that contains a counter for how many letters
- When a user enters a letter, it gets added to this array
- After the letter gets added to the array, it gets updated on the screen
- Once a letter has been guessed, it cannot be guessed again. If the user tries to guess the same letter, they get an alert asking them to make another guess
- When a letter is guessed, it is matched against the "answer_arr" to detect whether the letter is in the array (should return undefined if it's not in the array)
- 

Need to detect the index of each letter. When a character match is performed on the array, a loop function replaces each "_" with the appropriate letter matching the right index.
